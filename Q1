1st algorithm
    we would use the tf*idf scoring method to find the relevant documents since tf tells us how common a term occurs
    in a document while the idf score tells us how rare the term is in all the documents. Ths provides us with a very
    reasonable way to determine which documents are important taking into consideration the overall rareness of the
    term in the query. This is one of the most well known document representation methods.
